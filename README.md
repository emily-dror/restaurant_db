# PosgtreSQL based database written in Python

This project describes a delivery management application for a new
restaurant called "Yummy".

Customers of the app will be able to place orders and rate dishes. Managers of the app will be
able to add new dishes to the menu, update prices, and track the profits of the restaurant.
Typically, the data access layer facilitates the interaction of other components of the system
with the database by providing a simplified API that carries out a predefined desired set of
operations. A function in the API may receive business objects as Input arguments. These are
regular Python classes that hold special semantic meaning in the context of the application
(typically, all other system components are familiar with them). The PDF file that accompanies
this document contains the set of business objects to be considered in the assignment, as well
as the full (unimplemented) API.

## The provided files includes:
1. **Business Objects** – Predefined Python classes with specific semantic meanings.
2. **API Definition** – A complete, unimplemented set of API functions.
